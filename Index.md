# Top 5 Golang framework to learn in 2023
![programing photo](./images/hero-image.jpg)
[Golang](https://go.dev/doc/), or "Go," is an open source, statically typed programming language developed by Google to counter the shortcomings of other languages such as garbage collection in [C](https://devdocs.io/c/) and improve productivity. Since its initiation in 2007, Golang has grown to be one of the top 5 most preferred programming languages. The language is robust, scalable, and cross-platform, making it suitable for adoption by big tech companies such as Uber,  Google,  Twitch, etc.

This guide will provide a comprehensive look at the top 5 Golang frameworks you should use in your project in 2023.

## What is Golang framework 
While it's possible to develop real-world server-side applications from scratch using Go, it's a time-consuming and repetitive process. In addition, factors such as security, scalability, and speed must be taken into consideration. This is the exact problem that a framework tries to solve.

A framework refers to a set of pre-written code that you add to your code to provide a shortcut to solving a particular problem. Frameworks come with a wide collection of functions and methods that can be utilized by calling them and giving them parameters or arguments

Golang has over 25 known frameworks. Each framework has its own strengths and weaknesses that you should consider before using it.

## Which Golang framework should you use?
It's critical to do your homework before diving into a new framework.Here are some factors to consider before picking a framework.

### What do you need from the framework
Ensuring the great functionality of a product is more important than using technology that you are familiar with. You should always choose a framework that guarantees to solve your problem effectively.
### Good documentation
All developers use Google to code. Once you start your development journey, you will heavily rely on documentation to get past a bug or solve a specific problem. Learning a framework that has good documentation will make your journey easier.
### Active user base
As a developer, there will be times when you get stuck on a problem. During this time, it is advisable you look for someone with knowledge in the same domain for help. Learning a framework with a large community behind it makes it easy for you to find help.
### Is the frame work complete
 An incomplete framework may stop supporting some features since they were just for testing. This may put you out of business if you develop a product with it. In addition, choosing a framework that is constantly maintained ensures the scalability and security of your product.

### Jobs
It is advisable to learn a framework that has a large number of job opportunities. This might provide you a chance to earn while learning.
## Top 5 Golang framework
Let’s jump and take a look at the Golang frameworks.

### Gin 
Topping the list is the [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/docs/) framework. It is rated as one of the best frameworks for building fast and scalable web apps. Gin web apps are fast since they are built on top of Martini; Martini is a low-code package used to develop modern web apps.
 
 #### Advantages of using Gin
- Gin provides clean and easy-to-read code.
- Gin is built on top of Martini and is extremely fast.
- provides comprehensive error handling during HTTP requests.
- It's packaged with all the server-side functionality such as routing, middleware, etc.
- Gin has a huge community behind it.

  
  ### Installation
  Having installed Golang from [here](https://go.dev/doc/), You can follow the steps to get started with Gin,
  Create a project, navigate through the terminal, and type the below command.


  ```bash
  go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin 
  ```
  Now, to get gin into your code, import it by including this line in your code.

  ```golang
  
  import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    
  )
   ```
  now let’s write a basic syntax
```go
  //gin server
  package main
import (
  "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
  "net/http"

)

func main() {
  //great a  gin router 
	router  := gin.Default()

	// for handling GET request
	router.GET("/example", func(c *gin.Context) {

		//create a  simple json file
		c.JSON(200, gin.H{
			"message": "hello world",
		}) 
	})
	router.Run() // app will be listening at port 8080
}
```
### Beego
Inspired by Python Flask, [Beego](https://github.com/beego/beego) is used to build rapid enterprise level backend applications using GO. Beego also integrates easily with a wide range of tools, such as Python, Apache, Laravel, and many more.

#### advantage of using Beego
- Using MVC architecture speeds up server development.
- client-side can easily consume the Beego API end points.
- Beego has its own CRM.
- Beego has a large community on Github.
- With a Django background, it is simple to get there.

### installation 
create a project and navigate to the project via CMD or terminal.
type the below command
```bash
go get github.com/beego/beego/v2@latest
```
import Beego into your project
```go
import "github.com/beego/beego/v2/server/web"
```
Basic server syntax
```go

package main

import "github.com/beego/beego/v2/server/web"

func main() {
	web.Run()
}
```
### Echo
Since its release in 2015, [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/guide/) has been on the front line as a minimalistic and extensible Go framework. It is convenient when dealing with a wide variety of file types and a template engine.
### advantage of using echo
- it's a very minimalistic and scalable framework.
- it offers support for a wide variety of file types and HTTP requests.
- Using echo, you can create any tamplating engine.
- Support for automatic TSL certificate echo product security
- Echo has a large community behind it.

 
 ### installation
 Create a project and navigate to it via CMD or terminal.
Once there, type the below command.

 ```bash
 go get github.com/labstack/echo/v4
 ```
 import Echo into your project
 ```go 
 import ("github.com/labstack/echo/v4")
 ```
 here is syntax for basic server
 ```go
 //creating searver using echo
 package main

import (
	"net/http"
	
	"github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
)

func main() {
	e := echo.New()
	e.GET("/", func(c echo.Context) error {
		return c.String(http.StatusOK, "Hello World!")
	})
	e.Logger.Fatal(e.Start(":8080"))
}
```
### Kit
[Kit](https://gokit.io) framework is a programming toolkit for developing microservices using Go. Kit eliminates all complexity when developing microservices and ensures secure applications.
#### Advantage of using  kit framework
- This kit allows you to build secure microservices.
- it’s a fast method of creating  micro-services
- GO kit has a huge community behind it.
- kit offers extensive infrastructure integration.
- Kit provide convenient program design for micro-services.
### Fiber
[Fiber](https://docs.gofiber.io) is a node-express-inspired Golang framework that has seen tremendous growth since its release. Fiber is designed to smooth things out and create faster development.

### Advantage of using Fiber framework
- faster server-side development
- Fiber features a large collection of in-build middleware for various tasks.
- Fiber provide a low memory footprint.
- Fiber routes are simple to construct.
- easy to transit to if you have a Node Express background, and the opposite is true

### Installation
Create a project and navigate there via CMD.
On the CMD, enter the following command.

```bash
go get "github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
```
Utilize fiber by importing it by including the below snippet in your code.
```go
import "github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
```
syntax to create basic server
```go
// basic server using golang fiber
package main
import ("github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2")


func main() {
        app := fiber.New()
        app.Get("/", func (c *fiber.Ctx) error {
                return c.SendString("Hello, World")
        })
        app.Listen(":5000")//application will be listening at port 5000

}
```
## Conclusion
You have gotten a clear picture of the top Golang framework you should consider incorporating in your next project. With a large number of developers shifting to Golang, there will be no better time to equip yourself with these frameworks. The future is promising for Golang developers.
